# UCLA Trait Transects Protocol 
*17 January 2019*

## Goal
To survey three distinct areas of the UCLA Botanical Garden for plant taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity (Swenson 2011) using 5m modified Gentry transects (Gentry 1988, Phillips and Miller 2002). 

## Data collection steps

### Step 1: Survey group (blue group)
* Lay out 5m of transect tape and make sure the tape is set in place
* Starting at 0, mark and number the individual plants with flagging tape 
* Count those that fall within 1 meter of either side of the transect tape
* Record the site, date and taxonomic info (all blue columns)

### Step 2: Height group (red group)
* For each numbered plant, measure its height in centimeters (the red column)
* Measure from the ground to the topmost part of the plant
* For small plants use a ruler 
* For large plants use a measuring tape 

### Step 3: Leaf group (yellow group)
* For each numbered plant measure its leaf dimensions in millimeters (the yellow columns)
* Do this for 3 different leaves and only enter the average value  
* Mark each with flagging tap to tell them apart
* Use a ruler to measure leaf length 
* Use a ruler to measure leaf width 
* Use a micrometer to measure thickness of thin leaves 
* Use calipers to measure thickness of thick leaves
