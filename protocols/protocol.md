# UCLA Trait Transects Protocol 
*17 January 2019*

## Goal
To survey three distinct areas of the UCLA Botanical Garden for plant taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity (Swenson 2011) using 5m modified Gentry transects (Phillips and Miller 2002). 

## Data collection steps

### Step 1: Survey group (blue group)
* Lay out 5m of transect tape and make sure the tape is set in place
* Starting at 0, mark and number the individual plants with flagging tape 
* Count those that fall within 1 meter of either side of the transect tape
* Record the site, date and taxonomic info (all blue columns)

### Step 2: Height group (red group)
* For each numbered plant, measure its height in centimeters
* Measure from the ground to the topmost part of the plant
* For small plants use a ruler 
* For large plants use a measuring tape 

### Step 3: Leaf group (yellow group)
* For each numbered plant measure its leaf dimensions in millimeters
* Use the ruler to measure leaf length 
* Use the ruler to measure leaf width 
* Use the micrometer to measure thickness of thin leaves 
* Use the calipers to measure thickness of thick leaves
