# UCLA Trait Transects Protocol 
*17 January 2019*

## Goal
To survey three distinct areas of the UCLA Botanical Garden for plant taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity (Swenson 2011) using 5m modified Gentry transects (Gentry 1988, Phillips and Miller 2002). 

## Data collection steps

### Step 1: Survey group (blue group)
* Lay out 5 meters of transect tape and make sure the tape is set in place
* Starting at 0m, find plants whoâ€™s leaves or stem falls within 1 meter of either side of the transect tape
* Exclude plants >5m tall
* Mark and number the tags of the individual plants with flagging tape
* Start by going up the left side, then back down the right side
* Record the site, date and taxonomic info (all blue columns)

### Step 2: Height group (red group)
* For each numbered plant, measure its height in centimeters (the red column)
* Measure from the ground to the topmost part of the plant
* For small plants use a ruler 
* For large plants use a measuring tape 

### Step 3: Leaf group (yellow group)
* For each numbered plant measure its leaf dimensions (the yellow columns)
* Do this for 3 different leaves and only enter the average value  
* Mark each leaf with flagging tape to tell them apart
* Use a ruler to measure leaf length in centimeters
* Use a ruler to measure leaf width in centimeters
* Use calipers to measure thickness of leaves in millimeters
